# Homepage

My blog page is using Jekyll to render markdown files.  Check out the config and this [blog post](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/) for more details.  I have also specified some customizations to the rendering of Markdown within `_layouts/default.html` according to this [Resolved Issue](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/Remove-Heading/m-p/4371#M335).

## Todo

[ ] Add a header / maybe a sidebar to blog posts
[ ] I would love analytics to know if my content is popular!
