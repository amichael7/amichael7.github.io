Envision that you have a particularly dull assignment, you think to yourself, I will be more motivated to do this when the deadline is closer.  This happens all the time to all types of people, in fact, I did this yesterday and caused myself a great deal of stress!  Procrastination can defeat the best laid plans for producing excellent work, no matter the underlying psychological obstacle.  Common reasons for procrastination include apathy towards the task, a feeling that the task is meaningless, or an uncertain or far-away deadline.  However, regardless of the reason, procrastination is a particularly pernicious form of self-sabotage because often the only consequence is maybe handing in a crappy assignment or pushing a deadline.  What makes the problem worse is that the more you procrastinate, the better you will get at it.

What if you could change all that?  Enter chunking.  I watched a [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQMbvJNRpLE) (while procrastinating) that introduced me in very simple terms to the method, but framed in language that appealed to how I felt exactly at that moment.  So what is the chunking method?  Interestingly, chunking is a common way to improve cognitive efficiency in many areas<sup>1</sup>, but the area where I personally find I need the method most is in overcoming procrastination.  Chunking, applied to procrastination, is extremely simple: break down your projects or goals into smaller tasks.  While this advice is oft-repeated, I find it frustratingly vague so I did some research that I wanted to share here.

The following are the best pieces of advice I found for breaking down tasks into chunks:
1. __Give yourself tasks that will take at most 10-20 minutes.__  These tasks will allow you to see a result quickly and make progress; these minimal cross sections add up.
1. __It is not necessary to break down the entire task into 20-minute segments, only enough to keep you occupied.__ Don't get lost in the details of breaking the entire goal into segments, simply give yourself enough to build a to-do list.
1. __Reframe the task often.__ Complete a few segments, generate some more segments and/or change your segments list, repeat.
1. __Write down your tasks.__ Don't try to remember the segments, if you have a lot to do your working memory will get bogged down (even if you use chunking)

Since my schedule is fairly self-determined, I will try out the chunking method over the next month and update this entry with my results and with functional insights gained from this exercise!
