&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Getting there...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Envision that you have a particularly dull assignment, you think to yourself, I will be more motivated to do this when the deadline is closer.  This happens all the time to all types of people, in fact, I did this yesterday and caused myself a great deal of stress!  Procrastination can defeat the best laid plans for producing excellent work, no matter the underlying psychological obstacle.  Common reasons for procrastination include apathy towards the task, a feeling that the task is meaningless, or an uncertain or far-away deadline.  However, regardless of the reason, procrastination is a particularly pernicious form of self-sabatage because often the only consequence is maybe handing in a crappy assignment or pushing a deadline.  What makes the problem worse is that the more you procrastinate, the better you will get at it.</p>
<p>What if you could change all that?  Enter chunking.  I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQMbvJNRpLE">TED Talk</a> (while procrastinating) that introduced me in very simple terms to the method, but framed in language that appealed to how I felt exactly at that moment.  So what is the chunking method?  Interestingly, chunking is a common way to improve cognitive efficiency in many areas&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, but the area where I find that I personally most need the chunking method the most is in overcoming procrastination.  Chunking, applied to procrastination, is extremely simple, break down your tasks into smaller tasks.  While this advice is oft-repeated, I find it frustratingly vague, so I have done some research.</p>
<p>The following are what I hypothesis are the best steps to break down tasks for chunking:
1. <strong>Give yourself tasks that will take at most 10-20 minutes.</strong>  These tasks will allow you to see a result quickly and make progress; these minimal cross sections add up.
1. <strong>It is not necessary to break down the entire task into 20-minute segments, only enough to keep you occupied.</strong> Don&#39;t get lost in the details of breaking the entire goal into segments, simply give yourself enough to build a to-do list.
1. <strong>Reframe the task often.</strong> Complete a few segments, generate some more segments and/or change your segments list, repeat.
1. <strong>Write down your tasks.</strong> Don&#39;t try to remember the segments, if you have a lot to do your working memory will get bogged down (even if you use chunking)</p>
<p>Since my schedule is fairly self-determined, I will try out the chunking method over the next month and update this entry with my results and with functional insights gained from this exercise!</p>
